# Java-Mobile-Application-Game

1. GameWorld Map

Ship = black triangle
Missile = cyan rectangle
Asteroid = black circle
FlyingSaucer = green square
SpaceStation = magenta square


2. Animation control

Time increments faster than it should on the scoreboard but its okay for my game.


3. Collision Detection and Response

collidesWith() will detect the collision that occurs in the game
handleCollision() will check what game object and send response to collision() in GameWorld


4. Sound


5. Object Selection and Game Modes

Selecting an object will make it appear filled/unfilled depending on initial status
